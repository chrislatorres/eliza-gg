## Technical Summary

**Merged On**: 12/11/2024
**Author**: @sin-bufan
**Pull Request**: [#1002](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/1002)

### Description
# Relates to:

Adds callback to action in farcaster client

# Risks

Low
Only adds callback parameter to action handling
No structural changes to the codebase
No database schema changes

# Background

## What does this PR do?

Adds callback parameter implement in Farcaster client action handler to enable:

1. Proper action chaining
2. Response tracking for actions
3. Memory updates after action execution

## What kind of change is this?

Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)

## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?
The Farcaster client's action system needs to support callbacks for several reasons:

1. Actions often need to trigger follow-up responses
2. We need to track and store the results of actions
3. Some actions require updating the conversation memory
4. Complex action chains require proper state management

This improvement enables features such as:

- Multi-step action sequences
- Better error handling for actions
- Proper memory updates after action execution
- More sophisticated bot behaviors

# Documentation changes needed?

My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.

# Testing

## Where should a reviewer start?

1. Review the changes in packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts
2. Focus on the action handler implementation and callback integration

## Detailed testing steps

1. Set up a test Farcaster bot
2. Test an action that requires callbacks
3. Verify that:

- The action executes properly
- The callback is triggered
- Memory is updated correctly
- Any follow-up actions are properly chained
